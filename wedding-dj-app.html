                <p>
                    I questioned 5 participants. They were people between the ages 18-62 who reside all over the world.
                    Based on those interviews, I identified the main problem and defined the goal which should solve
                    this
                    problem.

                        <p>
                            There are too many DJs on the internet. All of them have their own website or social media.
                            profile.

                            There is no easy way to contact the selected DJs.

                            To create a straightforward workflow to send a request to the DJ without long browsing and
                            searching for the contact
                        </p>

                    I abstracted pain points from the interview quotes, and mapped out an end-to-end experience users
                    would
                    have.

                    I used the <strong>Crazy Eights method</strong> to sketch eight variations of my application to
                    generate more ideas. This is a method
                    where I need to sketch eight variations of one screen in eight minutes. Usually, people use A4 paper
                    folded three times to
                    create eight blocks. I used smaller paper but still followed the rule of eight sketches.
