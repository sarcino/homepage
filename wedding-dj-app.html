            <h1>Wedding DJ application</h1>
            <p>
                I created this project for the <a
                    href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/8245TZ4N4929"
                    target="_blank" aria-label="Certificate from the Coursera/ Google. Will open in a new tab.">Google
                    UX design course</a>. The goal was to create an application
                which will help to find and contact wedding DJs quickly without ineffective browsing the
                internet.
            </p>
            <img class="wide-picture" src="images/wedding-dj-headline.png"
                alt="Preview of a few screens of the website.">
            <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Is this application really important? How would it help users?</em> I asked myself.
            </p>
            <p>I conducted user research to understand users, know more details, and identify problems.
                At the same
                time I was able to define the goal of the application. I questioned 5
                participants. They were people between the ages 18-62 who reside all over the world.</p>
            <p>
                I was focused on
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    understanding the user goals and needs,
                </li>
                <li>
                    creating a user journey,
                </li>
                <li>
                    determining the success of the task.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I abstracted pain points from the interview quotes, and mapped out an end-to-end
                experience users would have.

                    <p>
                        There are too many DJs on the internet. All of them have their own website or
                        social media profiles. profile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no easy way to contact the selected DJs.

                    <p>
                        To create a straightforward workflow to send a request to the DJ without long
                        browsing and searching for the contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new workflow should speed up the process of wedding DJs booking.

            <h3>User journey map</h3>
            <p>
                I learned that users are worried about the price of services provided by the selected DJ. They are also
                struggling to find a proper option to contact DJs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on interviews, I created the below user journey map which includes tasks, actions,
                and feelings of users. I added opportunities which the application can bring to life.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-user-journey.png" alt="User journey for the project.">
            <h3>Experience map</h3>
            <p>
                This is a visualization of an entire end-to-end experience that users go through in
                order to accomplish the goal. I created this workflow using Draw.io.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-experience-map.png" alt="Experience map of the user.">

            <h2>Wireframing the solution</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the above problems identified, I worked towards addressing these pains by
                coming up with potential solutions which should be included in the application:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Filters</strong> - to help users to select DJs who meet requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ratings</strong> - to show how the other users were satisfied with the DJ
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Messages</strong> - users can send a message directly in the app. Messages
                    will be stored in one place which will speed up the process
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Profiles</strong> - users can learn more about the selected DJ from her or
                    his profile which includes a short description, technical details, photos, and
                    reviews
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-wireframe.png" alt="Black and white wireframes of the application.">

            <h2>Mockup</h2>
            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>
                I created a few color palettes. At the end, I chose a minimalistic color palette using different shades
                of grey and orange.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-color-palette.png" alt="Color palette.">
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>
                I continued with components creation in Figma to be able to keep the design consistent. Components also
                help me to speed
                up the design process. I started with designing buttons and inputs. Those are key components for the
                wedding application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you will find some components that I have used to design the application.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-components.png" alt="Some of the components used for the application.">
            <p>
                I also created a simple illustration in Adobe Illustrator for the get started screen.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-illustration.png" alt="The illustration of a DJ holding two vinyls.">
            <h3>Get started screen</h3>
            <p>
                This screen was created to encourage users to use the application and remind them of the
                goal.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-onboarding-page.png" alt="Onboarding page of the application.">
            <h3>Sign in</h3>
            <p>
                Users would fill in a simple sign in form. They can also sign in with their Google
                accounts.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-sign-in-page.png" alt="Sign in page of the application.">
            <h3>Search results</h3>
            <p>
                Users can easily filter search results by genre, price, and additional services.
            </p>
            <img src="images/wedding-dj-search-results-page.png" alt="Search screen of the application with filters.">
            <h3>Other screens</h3>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                At the end, I connected all the screens to create a high-fidelity prototype.
            </p>
