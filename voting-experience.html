                <strong>Project duration:</strong> November 2022 - February 2023<br />
                <strong>My responsibilities:</strong> discovery, user journey mapping, user research, service blueprint
                design<br />
                <strong>My approach:</strong> I focused on understanding the voting process and then continued by
                creating personas/archetypes and designing a service blueprint.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Background
            </h2>
            <p>
                The U.S. presidential election is an interesting phenomenon for a European citizen. It is also a
                reminder that elections are a user experience problem that can impact the end result in multiple ways.
            </p>
            <h3>
                1. Ballot design could potentially flipp the results
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the 2020 general election, <a
                        href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2020.0708?journalCode=elj" target="_blank"
                        aria-label="Auditing the 2020 General Election in Georgia. Will open in a new tab.">two-column
                        ballot design led roughly 4200 voters to select more than
                        one candidate</a> for Senate and their votes were invalid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More than half a million Americans who voted by mail in 2020 had their ballots thrown out and never
                    counted, mostly because of easy-to-fix mistakes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Elections can be confusing for some voters</h3>
            <p>
                The U.S. is a republic of states that all have their own processes and rules, there’s little consistency
                from one place to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the <a
                    href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/10/31/views-of-the-voting-experience-how-voters-are-casting-ballots-this-fall/"
                    target="_blank" aria-label="Statistics about election on the Pew Research website. Will open in a new tab.">Pew Research Center</a> 23% of registered voters say voting in elections is
                confusing and 18% say it is not convenient.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Voter turnout could be increased</h3>
            <p>
                More than 158.4 million people voted in that election, amounting to 62.8% of people of voting age. When
                comparing turnout among the voting-age population in the 2020 presidential election against recent
                national elections in 49 other countries, the U.S. ranks 31st – between Colombia and Greece.
            </p>


            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                I decided <strong>to map the U.S. general election process by creating a service blueprint, identifying
                    pain points
                    and ideas or possible solutions</strong> which could improve voters' experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                To understand the most common problems a voter can face, I did online research to create a list of
                themes, potential pain points, and improvement ideas.

            </p>
            <p>
                Going through tons of articles, forums, and other research allowed to identify all relevant information.
                A&nbsp;lot of manual effort went into categorizing the data and turn that into meaningful themes.
            </p>
            <img src="images/elections-themes.png" alt="Opened paper notepad with a list of themes and issues."
                class="image-small">
            <p>
                Soon, it became apparent that similar problems appear across the themes and I decided to group them.

            <h2>Service blueprint preparation.<br />
                Paper version</h2>
            <p>
                Every eligible voter can choose from a few voting options which he or she needs to decide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    voting in person on Election Day,
                </li>
                <li>
                    early voting,
                </li>
                <li>
                    voting by mail,
                </li>
                <li>
                    voting by mail in the Military.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I chose to map the <strong>journey of a voter who registered to vote in person on Election Day</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>user journey</strong>
                creation is the starting point which will show the average experience of a U.S. voter.

                I added touchpoints and other supporting elements and <strong>mapped the responsibilities of poll
                    workers, local election offices and state representatives</strong>.

                class="image-small">
            <h2>First digital version</h2>
            <p>
                After a few rounds of reviews of the paper version, I created a digital version of the service blueprint
                in Figma.
            </p>
            <img src="images/elections-service-blueprint.png" class="image-small"
                alt="Preview of the service blueprint with user journey on the top.">
            <p>
                Since the user journey map mostly shows the theoretical steps, <strong>I conducted a user research to
                    learn more about voters and refine
                    the
                    user journey based on my learnings.</strong>
            </p>
            <h2>User research</h2>
            <p>
                It was difficult to recruit participants for interviews so a Google form with open-ended questions was
                needed to collect voter opinions. At the beginning of
                January, I started to recruit participants in LinkedIn and on Facebook groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                I appreciated that people were willing to share their opinions. In the end, <strong>I was able to reach
                    mainly
                    voters who voted in up to three elections in total</strong>. All of them know the registration
                process and most
                of them have some experience with in-person voting.
            </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>two biggest challenges</strong> were getting familiar with all the information about U.S. elections and then
                finding participants for the user research.
            </p>
            <p>Designing the questionnaire was trickier than expected because there are a lot of question that can be
                asked but a <strong>long form would probably discourage people</strong> from answering them.
            </p>
            <p>It would be interesting to ask <strong>follow up questions</strong> to the users but the online forms have their
                limitations.</p>
            <p>
                Answers from the user research showed that people do not think about practical problems but about <strong>issues
                which are highlighted in media</strong>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Observing people</strong> go through the election steps would help identify additional pain points and inspire new
                ideas to adjust the user journey. If I were located in the U.S., I would observe users instead of using
                online questionnaires.</p>
