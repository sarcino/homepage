                        I had the pleasure to work with Sarka for almost two years. Not only she has excellent
                        people skills and is able to work seamlessly with many different roles both
                        internally
                        and externally, her technical knowledge is&nbsp;also of&nbsp;the&nbsp;highest level.
                        <br>
                        She’s extremely
                        fast learner, quickly grasps and further develops any processes or workflows we
                        worked
                        with.
                        <br>
                        Sarka has very deep knowledge of web standards, technologies and&nbsp;great
                        understanding of topics such&nbsp;as&nbsp;SEO, Accessibility and&nbsp;Web Analytics.
                        <br>
                        I can
                        wholeheartedly recommend Sarka, as she will be and excellent addition to any team.

                        and&nbsp;self-motivated, and&nbsp;she can work both independently and as part of a team.
