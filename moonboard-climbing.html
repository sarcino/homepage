                <strong>Project duration:</strong> January 2023 - March 2023<br />
                <strong>My responsibilities:</strong> discovery, user journey mapping, user research, wireframing,
                prototyping, UI design<br />
                <strong>My approach:</strong> I focused on understanding how climbers use this application and how the
                design can improve their experience.
            </p>
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
                The MoonBoard is the Standardized Interactive Climbing Training Board. The user downloads an
                application, connects the phone with the wall using bluetooth, and selects the desired route from the
                database. The selected route will be highlighted with LED lights on the wall.
            </p>
            <h3>The first experience</h3>
            <p>
                My climbing buddy downloaded the application and wanted to connect the application to the wall but
                without any success.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wall had two buttons - red one and blue one. There was no information on the wall or in the
                application. He tried to turn on the wall with a red button and activate the bluetooth with a blue one.
                With no success.
            </p>
            <p>
                This not very successful experience made me think about the application. Do other users have similar
                experiences?
            </p>
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                To understand users, I started to search for opinions and reviews on Google Play and App Store.

                The MoonBoard App is designed to support the MoonBoard website and both standard and LED MoonBoards. Key
                goals and principles are clear:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    create a simple and functional design,
                </li>
                <li>
                    work with local suppliers to avoid unnecessary transportation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Market research</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, there are already a few training solutions and apps on the market. The three main I looked
                into were Tension Board, Kilter Board and Grasshopper Board. All of them were developed by Aurora
                Climbing.
