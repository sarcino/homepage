                This project was created for the Figma UI/UX Design Course.
            </p>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To create an <strong>e-commerce purchase flow for a randomly selected product</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The flow should include: Homepage, Product Features page, Checkout page, and a Confirmation page
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Confirmation flow should include a <strong>simple animation created in Figma only</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>
                Here you will find all the colors that I have used to design this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The usage of red color was inspired by the picture of the product which is mainly black with red
                details.
                While calming blue color brings a feel of reliability.

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted a remote unmoderated usability study on three participants. Participants were two males and
                    one female between the ages 18-40. Participants were asked to finish the main workflow while using a
                    high fidelity prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of them were able to buy and order the drone and finish the workflow. The only one issue which was
                    considered as problematic was missing the information about prince on the page with the detail of the
                    product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I modified the <a
