                    Martin is in his 50’s and is married with children. He is a high school graduate and run a large
                    company.
                    Martin lives in Germany and is very familiar with your product. He enjoys time considering his next
                    purchase.

                <p>
                    The usage of red color was inspired by the picture of the product which is mainly black with red
                    details.
                    While calming blue color brings a feel of trust and reliability.
