            <p>
                This project was created for the Figma UI/UX Design Course. The goal was to create an e-commerce
                purchase flow for a randomly selected product. The flow should include: homepage, product features page,
                checkout page, and a confirmation page. The confirmation flow should include a simple animation.
            </p>
            <section class="two-columns">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Tools:
                        </strong>
                        I used Figma and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <strong>I was working on:</strong> wireframing, prototyping, mock up creation, high
                        fidelity prototype
                        creation, and illustrations.

            <h2>Low-fidelity prototype</h2>
            <p>
                I started with creating a list of pages I need to design:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homepage</li>
                <li>Product detail</li>
                <li>Reviews</li>
                <li>Cart with the order details</li>
                <li>Shipping details</li>
                <li>Checkout page for online payment</li>
                <li>Confirmation</li>
                <li>404</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I prepared wireframes of those screens and connected them into a low-fidelity prototype.
            </p>
            <img src="images/shark-drone-wireframe.png" alt="Preview of wireframes.">
            <p>
                I started with wireframing mobile versions of the website. The desktop version will follow.
            </p>

            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>
                Here you will find all the colors that I have used to design this website.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Red color</strong> was inspired by the product. The promoted drone use red and black colors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Blue color</strong> brings a feel of trust and reliability. It is a calming color which can
                    be in a contradiction to the red color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Black color</strong> for copy and text content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Yellow color</strong> for other small elements, e.g. stars used in reviews.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I played with the shades and defined the final colors.</p>
            <h2>Font</h2>
            <p>
                I prepared a few font pairings and chose the one which I like the most:
                the combination of fonts Oswald and Raleway.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Oswald</strong> for headlines and buttons
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Raleway</strong> for the rest of the copy, paragraphs, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/shark-drone-article.png" alt="Screenshot of font pairings.">
            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p>
                For the first component, I decided to create a navigation. I started with two versions - with an empty
                basket and a full basket. I also created buttons - CTA button, underlined link, payment button, play
                button for the video which will be displayed on the homepage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you will find some components that I have used to design this website.
            </p>

            <h2>High-fidelity prototype</h2>
            <p>
                I used selected colors, fonts and components to follow wireframes and create a high-fidelity prototype
                in
                Figma.
            </p>

                    target="_blank" aria-label="High fidelity prototype preview in Figma. Will open in a new tab.">See
                    the high-fidelity prototype of the mobile version</a>
            </p>
            <img src="images/shark-drone-hi-fi.png" alt="Screenshot from Figma of the high-fidelity prototype.">

            <h2>Desktop mock up</h2>

            <section class="two-columns">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I adjusted the components a bit and created a desktop version of the homepage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project is still in progress. I will continue with preparing the remaining pages for the
                        desktop version and will work on user research.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/shark-drone-desktop-mockup.png" alt="Mock up of the homepage.">
