                            My name is Šárka. I come from Prague, Czech Republic.

                        <p>
                            My background is varied and my skill set is versatile. I have experience working for
                            different types of companies such as the Czech Radio, Rockwell Automation, Wunderman
                            Thompson, and Microsoft.

                            I love to see visible outputs of everything I’m doing. I’m passionate about <strong>UX,

                        <p>
                            I'm a fast learner who enjoys working in international teams. I also like learning anything
                            new within my position and in my free time as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I consider myself a highly motivated and driven person who likes working on
                            <strong>meaningful
                                tasks</strong>.

                            When I’m not working I can be found doing yoga, drinking coffee, and taking photos with my
                            old school camera. I’m interested in sustainability and making my own cosmetics products.
